# authors-books-sales

Run `node --version` to make sure node.js is installed <br>

### Part 1
Check the `part1_queries.sql` file, which is directly under this repo folder

### Part 2
`cd server` and run `node index.js` to see the API server
#### Part 2A
The url `localhost:8888/top-10-authors` gives a response containing all top 10 performing authors
If we want to give a value to the optional query author_name, add `?author_name={value}` after the url `localhost:8888/top-10-authors`.
For example: `http://localhost:8888/top-10-authors?auth_name=Sophia%20Thomas` 
The input author name is case insensitive, so `http://localhost:8888/top-10-authors?auth_name=sophia%20thomas` also return the same JSON payload.<br>
Note that don't put quotes around the value of the query parameter.<br>
It's okay to replace %20 as a white space in the url.<br>
#### Part 2B
`async` and `await` are used to optimize the performance of the API endpoint

### Part 3
`cd client` and run `node index.js`, keep this terminal running<br>
Open a new terminal, `cd client` and run `npm start`. The frontend of this API should show up in the browser.
