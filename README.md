`cd server` and run `node index.js` to see the API server


### Part 1
Check the `part1_queries.sql` file, which is directly under this repo folder

### Part 2
#### Part 2A
If we want to give the optional query author_name a value...<br>
Example: http://localhost:8888/top-10-authors?auth_name=Sophia%20Thomas case insensitive. http://localhost:8888/top-10-authors?auth_name=sophia%20thomas also return the same JSON payload.<br>
Note that don't put quotes around the value of the query parameter.<br>
It's okay to replace %20 as a white space in the url.<br>
#### Part 2B
`async` and `await` are used to optimize the performance of the API endpoint
